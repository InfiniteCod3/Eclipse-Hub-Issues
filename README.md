# Eclipse Hub Issues
Hello! This webpage was created so you can figure out your eclipse hub issues here.<br>Please note that I do not own Eclipse Hub, and this is an unofficial website created by me. Eclipse Hub was created by [£thanoj1#3304](https://discord.com/users/534231910180716565).<br>
If none of these solutions seem to work for you, please contact £thanoj1 for assistance.


### Hub Not Loading
This is a common issue. What you would have to do is try rejoining.<br>
This should fix the issue. If not then it should be your internet connection. Check your internet and try again.<br>
Check the Eclipse discord server for any announcements, the hub might not be working at the moment, or the game script might be patched.<br>
If none of these work, try again later, or wait patiently till it loads.

### Premium Not Loading
If you are a premium user and you do not have the premium perks, try visiting the [Eclipse Hub Website](https://eclipsehub.xyz).<br>
Sign in and look for a button called "GEN SCRIPT". Click that button. The button will copy a loadstring with your key to your clipboard.<br>
Paste the copied text onto you executor, and execute that. Premium should now load.<br>
If premium still fails to load, click on the "RESET HWID" button. Then try executing again.<br>
Please do not share your key with anyone else, as you could get blacklisted from using the hub.<br><br>

More issues and ways to fix them will be comming soon.
