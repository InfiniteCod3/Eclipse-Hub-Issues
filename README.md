Helllo! This webpage was created so you can figure out your eclipse hub issues here.<br>Please note that I do not own Eclipse Hub. Eclipse Hub was created by [Â£thanoj1#3304](https://discord.com/users/534231910180716565)

### Hub Not loading
This is a common issue. What you would have to do is try rejoining (close the roblox window and restart roblox, and re attatch and re execute).<br>This should fix the issue. If not then it should be your internet connection. Check your internet and try again.
