# Eclipse Hub Issues
Hello! This webpage was created so you can figure out your eclipse hub issues here.<br>Please note that I do not own Eclipse Hub, and this is an unofficial website created by me. Eclipse Hub was created by [£thanoj1#3304](https://discord.com/users/534231910180716565).<br>
If none of these solutions seem to work for you, please contact £thanoj1 for assistance.


### Hub Not Loading
This is a common issue. What you would have to do is try rejoining.<br>
This should fix the issue. If not then it should be your internet connection. Check your internet and try again.<br>
Check the Eclipse discord server for any announcements, the hub might not be working at the moment, or the game script might be patched.<br>
If none of these work, try again later, or wait patiently till it loads.

### Premium Not Loading
If you are a premium user and you do not have the premium perks, try visiting the [Eclipse Hub Website](https://eclipsehub.xyz).<br>
Sign in and look for a button called "GEN SCRIPT". Click that button. The button will copy a loadstring with your key to your clipboard.<br>
Paste the copied text onto you executor, and execute that. Premium should now load.<br>
If premium still fails to load, click on the "RESET HWID" button. Then try executing again.<br>
Please do not share your key with anyone else, as you could get blacklisted from using the hub.<br><br>

### No Premium Badge in the Discord Server
If you are a premium user and you do not have the discord premium role like the others do, simply visit a bot commands channel in the discord and type `!givebuyer`.<br>
The command will give you the premium role. Please note that to get the role you will need to link your discord account to the Eclipse Hub website, so visit the website and click on the "LINK DISCORD" button and link your discord account.

### Cannot get into the Eclipse Hub Discord Server
To get in the discord server, you will need to execute the script. In the home page, there should be a discord icon at the top. Click that button to copy your discord invite to the server. Please note that you cannot invite anyone else to the server. If they want to join, they will have to join through the script.

More issues and ways to fix them will be comming soon.
